# Carewell BigCommerce API SDK

This repository is a fork of the [BigCommerce Docs](https://github.com/bigcommerce/docs) repository which, among other 
information, contains the OpenAPI YAML specifications for the entirety of the BigCommerce API. This SDK extends this 
repository to:

- Provide tooling to build the OpenAPI spec documents
- Provide a basic Typescript client using Axios that supports both REST and GraphQL calls
